    <img src="images/derp.jpg" alt="picture of a tooth">
<p>During the time of quaratine, it is important to stay active and have a healthy mindset.</p>

<ul>Individuals are strongly encouraged to:
  <li>keep up with daily exercises</li>
  <li>staying up to date with current situations</li>
  <Li>make use of your time by learning, picking up new hobbies, foster a furry friend.</Li>
  <li>stay home, stay sane, seek help when needed!</li>
</ul>

<p>Ways to maintain good oral health</p>
<ul>A long stay at home can contribute to many negative side effects such as periodontal issues, or caries development. 
  you can help to reduce your risk by: 
  <li>brushing morning and night</li>
  <li>flossing after every meal</li>
  <li>limiting snacking (snacking makes the PH of your saliva more acidic, therefore constant snacking puts you at a higher risk for cavities.</li>
  <li>take advantage of your flouride rinse (flouride helps to re-mineralize your enamel, therefore making it strong).</li>
  <li>minize stress to reduce the chance of grinding your teeth at night. (be sure to wear your nightguard if you do grind) grinding can cause tooth fractures and vertical bone loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, we are alone together!</p>
